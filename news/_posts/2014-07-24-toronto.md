> <p>The PoC Team was composed of Verizon, Telefonica, Cumulus Networks, Mojatatu Networks, and the University of Patras demonstrated separation of control and datapath scaling of a 3GPP PGW.</p>
> <p>The programmatic abstractions provided by the ForCES LFB model were utilized to describe VNFs, services and the infrastructure definition in a clear, formal and concise approach. The ForCES protocol was used for SDN control and NFV management for all modelled elements.</p>
